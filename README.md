# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the final product aligns with stakeholder expectations and project goals. Below are three key reasons why it's critical:

🔍 Clear Understanding of Project Scope
Requirement Analysis helps define the boundaries of the project by gathering and documenting stakeholder needs. This prevents scope creep, minimizes misunderstandings, and ensures that everyone involved is aligned from the beginning.

⚙️ Efficient Resource Allocation
With well-defined requirements, development teams can plan timelines, assign resources, and choose technologies more effectively. This reduces the risk of rework and budget overruns by aligning technical decisions with business goals early on.

✅ Basis for Testing and Validation
Requirements serve as the foundation for creating acceptance criteria and test cases. This makes it easier to validate whether the final system meets user needs, improves software quality, and boosts user satisfaction.

# 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that help ensure the software meets user expectations and business goals. Below are the five key activities:

📥 Requirement Gathering
- Collecting high-level needs and expectations from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, or reviewing existing systems.

🗣️ Requirement Elicitation
- Engaging stakeholders using techniques like brainstorming, workshops, use case development, and prototyping to refine and uncover deeper or hidden requirements.

📝 Requirement Documentation
- Clearly writing down the gathered requirements in structured formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case diagrams for shared understanding.

🧩 Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- Analyzing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Visual models (e.g., use case diagrams, data flow diagrams) are used to represent system behavior and interactions.

✅ Requirement Validation
- Reviewing documented requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy, resolve ambiguities, and ensure alignment with business needs before development begins.

## 🧾 Types of Requirements
In any software project, understanding and categorizing requirements correctly ensures the system delivers both expected functionality and performance. Below are the two main types of requirements for the Booking Management System.

✅ Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do. They describe the system’s behaviors, features, and interactions from a user’s perspective.

Examples for the Booking Management System:

- Users can search available properties based on location, price, and dates.

- The system allows user registration and login with email and password.

- Users can create, edit, and cancel bookings.

- Property owners can list and manage their properties.

- The system sends confirmation emails after successful bookings.

⚙️ Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system should perform. They include quality attributes such as performance, security, and scalability.

Examples for the Booking Management System:

- The system should load any page in under 2 seconds.

- It must be available 24/7 with 99.9% uptime.

- All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.

- The platform should support up to 10,000 concurrent users.

- It should be accessible on mobile and desktop devices with a responsive design.

🧩 Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of a system’s functional requirements. They illustrate how different users (called actors) interact with the system through various use cases (functionalities). These diagrams help stakeholders understand system behavior at a high level, making them useful for both communication and planning during the Requirement Analysis phase.

🎯 Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
Clarify system scope and interactions.

Identify all possible user interactions early in development.

Improve communication between developers, designers, and non-technical stakeholders.

Serve as a foundation for writing user stories or test cases.

## 🧩 Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually show how users interact with the system. They help teams understand scope, system behavior, and responsibilities early in the development cycle.
