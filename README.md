# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the final product aligns with stakeholder expectations and project goals. Below are three key reasons why it's critical:

🔍 Clear Understanding of Project Scope
Requirement Analysis helps define the boundaries of the project by gathering and documenting stakeholder needs. This prevents scope creep, minimizes misunderstandings, and ensures that everyone involved is aligned from the beginning.

⚙️ Efficient Resource Allocation
With well-defined requirements, development teams can plan timelines, assign resources, and choose technologies more effectively. This reduces the risk of rework and budget overruns by aligning technical decisions with business goals early on.

✅ Basis for Testing and Validation
Requirements serve as the foundation for creating acceptance criteria and test cases. This makes it easier to validate whether the final system meets user needs, improves software quality, and boosts user satisfaction.

# 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that help ensure the software meets user expectations and business goals. Below are the five key activities:

📥 Requirement Gathering
- Collecting high-level needs and expectations from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, or reviewing existing systems.

🗣️ Requirement Elicitation
- Engaging stakeholders using techniques like brainstorming, workshops, use case development, and prototyping to refine and uncover deeper or hidden requirements.

📝 Requirement Documentation
- Clearly writing down the gathered requirements in structured formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case diagrams for shared understanding.

🧩 Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- Analyzing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Visual models (e.g., use case diagrams, data flow diagrams) are used to represent system behavior and interactions.

✅ Requirement Validation
- Reviewing documented requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy, resolve ambiguities, and ensure alignment with business needs before development begins.
