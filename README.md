# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the final product aligns with stakeholder expectations and project goals. Below are three key reasons why it's critical:

üîç Clear Understanding of Project Scope
Requirement Analysis helps define the boundaries of the project by gathering and documenting stakeholder needs. This prevents scope creep, minimizes misunderstandings, and ensures that everyone involved is aligned from the beginning.

‚öôÔ∏è Efficient Resource Allocation
With well-defined requirements, development teams can plan timelines, assign resources, and choose technologies more effectively. This reduces the risk of rework and budget overruns by aligning technical decisions with business goals early on.

‚úÖ Basis for Testing and Validation
Requirements serve as the foundation for creating acceptance criteria and test cases. This makes it easier to validate whether the final system meets user needs, improves software quality, and boosts user satisfaction.
